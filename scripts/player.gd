# TODO:  Game Concept: Size Matters TODO
# Overview 
# "Size Matters" is a physics-based puzzle-platformer where players manipulate the size of their character  
# and objects to navigate through challenging environments. The core mechanic revolves around resizing  
# to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, and explore different paths within the levels. 

# TODO:  Energy System: TODO
#
#Resizing consumes energy, which is replenished by collecting energy orbs scattered throughout the levels.
#Strategic resizing is essential, as running out of energy leaves the player unable to change size until more
#is found.

# TODO:  Environmental Interaction: TODO
#
#Certain objects react differently based on size. For example, a small character can walk on fragile surfaces
#without breaking them, while a larger character can break through barriers.
#Water behaves differently with size, allowing large characters to float and small ones to sink, adding a 
#layer of strategy to water-based puzzles.

# TODO:  Sound: TODO
#
#An adaptive soundtrack that changes with the playerâ€™s size, becoming more intense or subtle depending
#on whether the character is large or small.
#Sound effects that highlight the resizing process, such as a stretching noise for growing and a
#compressing sound for shrinking.

# TODO: Resizing Mechanic: TODO

#Players can change their character's size at will, shrinking to fit through tight spaces or growing to
#reach high platforms.
#Objects in the environment can also be resized, such as shrinking a boulder to move it or enlarging a 
#key to unlock a massive door.
